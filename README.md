# Kurthia-sibirica
Translation of Kurthia sibirica, A New Bacterial Species of the Kurthia Genus, by V.A. Belikova, N.V. Cherevach, L.V. Kalakutski, Mikrobiologija, Volume 55, Issue 5, pp. 831-835, published in 1986.

My name is Kyle MacLea, an Assistant Professor at the University of New Hampshire in the field of Microbiology. I am working on the bacterium Kurthia sibirica, isolated from the Magadan mammoth from eastern Siberia.  The first report of this bacterium in a paper that is written in Russian, Belikova VA, Cherevach N V, Kalakutskiĭ L V. 1986. [New species of bacteria in the genus Kurthia--Kurthia sibirica sp. nov]. Mikrobiologiia 55:831–5. I don't read Russian, so I asked Thomas Kulik, a security officer at UNH in Manchester and reader of Russian, to translate it for me. This was not intended to be a definitive Russian translation but rather a "good-enough" translation to work with the organism, and so I imagine the translation could be improved.  I think the translation is quite good, however, and I hope that it can be helpful to my colleagues who would also like to read this paper. This translation is intended for scholarly research.
